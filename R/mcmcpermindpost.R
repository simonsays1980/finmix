#' Finmix `mcmcpermindpost` class
#' 
#' @description 
#' This class defines objects to store the outputs from permuting the MCMC 
#' samples. Due to label switching the sampled component parameters are usually 
#' not assigned to the same component in each iteration. To overcome this issue 
#' the samples are permuted by using a relabeling algorithm (usually K-means) 
#' to reassign parameters. Note that due to assignment of parameters from the 
#' same iteration to the same component, the sample size could shrink. 
#' 
#' This class is supplementing the parent class by adding a slot to store the 
#' permuted parameter samples of the posterior densities.
#' 
#' @slot postperm A named list containing a named list `par` with array(s) of 
#'   parameters from the posterior density.
