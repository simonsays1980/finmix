#' Finmix `mcmcpermindhier` class
#' 
#' @description 
#' This class defines objects to store the outputs from permuting the MCMC 
#' samples. Due to label switching the sampled component parameters are usually 
#' not assigned to the same component in each iteration. To overcome this issue 
#' the samples are permuted by using a relabeling algorithm (usually K-means) 
#' to reassign parameters. Note that due to assignment of parameters from the 
#' same iteration to the same component, the sample size could shrink. 
#' 
#' This class is supplementing the parent class by adding a slot to store the 
#' permuted parameter samples of the hierarchical prior.
#' 
#' Note that for models with fixed indicators `weight`s do not get permuted.
#' 
#' @slot hyperperm A named list containing the (permuted) parameters of the 
#'   hierarchical prior.
